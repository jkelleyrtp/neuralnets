# neuronets (with Rust!)

This repository holds the code for my final project in Neurotechnology - a neural network trained to play rock paper scissors.

The code is divided into two sprints:

Sprint 1
- a basic feed-forward neural network 
- a slightly more advanced recurrent neural network

Sprint 2
- An LSTM auto-encoder 
- A convolutional neural network

Each of these mini projects are implemented in Rust, with the EMG data under test having been acquired by anonymized human subjects.
