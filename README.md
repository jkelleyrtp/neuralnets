# neuronets (with Rust!)

This repository holds the code for my final project in Neurotechnology - a neural network trained to play rock paper scissors.

The code is divided into two sprints:

Sprint 1
- a basic RNN and CNN to analyze EMG data after-the-fact

Sprint 2
- PCA/tSNE of EMG data
- transfer learning
- LSTM
